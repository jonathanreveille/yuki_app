## welcome to my final project of the Python Developer Course for OpenClassrooms ##

## I have decided to create an application that allows pet owners to set tasks, schedules for their cats ##

##### What is in this project ? #####

* Use of Django Framework.
* Use of OOP and Python 3.7.
* Function based views, and Class based views
* Use of pipenv
* Django Restful Framework (DRF) - coming soon
* Respect and follow recommendations from PEP8 (style guide)

What you will be able to do in this application :

##### For pet owners #####
1. Create a Profile
2. Customize your profile
3. Create a pet
4. Create your own tasks
5. Create schedules from your tasks for a specific or more cats
6. Search for the schedule of a specific cat
7. Create an inventory of every accessories your cat needs

##### For catsitters (in progress...) #####
1. Create your own profile
2. Show your capacity of hosting cats
3. Communicate with owners that reach out through messages in-app for catsitting
4. Access a cat schedule


#### To Run Test with Coverage
```coverage run --source="." manage.py test```
